**Note**:
If while executing the program the core gets dumped, run the following command 
$ tput rmcup
This is to be done to come back to normal terminal, as the editor runs on alternate screen (If the shell has that feature)
(Core dump will happen in case of insert to an empty file or on an empty line)
To run type:
$ make
$ ./vi_editor [filename]
